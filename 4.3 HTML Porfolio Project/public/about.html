  <p>Number Code <br>
    143 I Love You <br>
    523 I Love It So Much <br>
    531 I Love You A Lot <br>
    312 I Love You Too</p>
  <p>You probably think why i choose to make a paragraph like this with lots of 'br' instead
    of making a simple list.The answer is simple because coding it's like a <sup>poem</sup> so
    <strong>i can do it if i want </strong> for my own pleasure.

  <h2>My mind at 6am:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>let's do some html</li>
    <li>let's see what css we can apply</li>
    <li>i want to know more JS...</li>
    <li>ok ok i dont want to get you bored so i will end this list</li>
  </ul>
  <a href="https://smashthewalls.com/" target="_blank">i put this here just and because i like it</a>
  <pre><code>I just want to type different right now and let's take a long break without 
   using 'br'             ,yes i can do it because i use pre and code so
   my html is reading the free spaces, oh yes we can do this if you didnt
   knew already</code></pre>
  <p>Hope you get my crazy brain and we will match </p>
  <p>I was playing football for 13 years but a not easy injury
    at my knee put me down so i have a lot of free time and now
    i wanna be the best in coding because this is me i'm the best or if i'm not
    already the best i'm going to be in close future</p>
